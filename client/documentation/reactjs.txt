Q&A

What is State variable?
The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component.
In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

Difference between props and state in react?
The key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.
Note: props fields are readonly.

Why we need setState()?
In React, the changes won't be automatically updated/reflected as like in Angular. Hence we need setState().
When you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.
Whenever setState() is called, it will call the render() each and everytime **

React Life Cycle Hooks?
